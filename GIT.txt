Version Control System (VCS):
-a system that records changes made to a file or set of files overtime so that we can recal any specific version later.
- keeps track of every modification to the code.
- Restoring previous versions
- Team members can work parallelly.

Types of VCS:
1. Centralised VCS (CVCS)
-We have a single copy of the project on the central server
-We can make the changes to this central copy on the central server
-Single point of failure
-Provides transparency
-Remote changes are slow
-SVN

2. Distributed VCS (DVCS):
- we don't have to rely on the central server
-we can clone/copy the project to our local machines and can make changes in our local systems
-Users will have the entire project in their local including the history of the project
-Actions are fast except push and pull
-No dependency on the central server
-Takes space in the local system
-Cloning takes time.
-GIT

VCS terms:

-Repository (repo): A place where all te files and their history is stored, usually on a remote server
- Clone: Creating(Copying) a Repo from another repo
-Conflict: When different users make changes to the same file and the system is not able to resolve it.
-Merge: Integrating 2 changes together
- Initialize: Creating a new, empty repo
-Branch:Set of files under version control may be branched at a certain point in time so that , from that point in time, 2 copies of those files are available for change independently.
