Operating System
- Establish user interface
-Manages the computer's resources
- Provides resources to the application and helps to run the application on the computer

Programming Language
-language helps us to communicate with the computer
-Programming language has :
  - keywords: pre-defined wordds
  - syntax:set of rules used to write any program
  
  Type of programming languages:
   - Low level language (LLL)
     - Binary
     - Close to machine
     - Difficult to read, code
     - Faster
     - Not portable- machine dependent
     - Assembly language
   - High level language (HLL)
     - Human uderstandable language (close to how humans communicate)
     - Easier to code
     - May take more time to translate to machine understandable code
     - Portable - can run on any platform
     - Java, python
     
Python & it's features
 - Open source
 -Easier to code, learn, debug, understand
 - Huge number of library support
 - Community support
 - general purpose language
 - Portable
 - Dynamically typed
 - Memory management is automatic
 - Flexible
 - may not be fast compared to other languages as c++ or java
 
Compiler and Interpreter
  - Translators
  -is used to translate the program into machine executable code
  
Compiler
 - Translates the entire code at a time
 - Faster
 - Errors will be shown at the end of compilation
 
Interpreter
 - Translates the code line by line
 - Slower
 - Errors are shown line by line
 
Source code:
 - Code/ program that we write
 
Machine code:
 - Machine executable code
 
Intermediate code:
 - Object code: Java
 - Byte code : Python
 - Executable code: C
 
Internal working of Python
 - Source code (.py) -----> Byte code(.pyc) --- PVM (Interpreter) ----> Machine executable code
 
 Byte code (.pyc) is saved in _pycache_ folder
 
 PVM- python virtual machine
 
Errors in Python:
 
 - Compile time errors
   - Syntax error
   - Indentation error
   - If there is a compile time error, Byte code will not be generated
   - During compilation, only syntax and indentation are checked
 
 
 - Run time erros
   - Happens while the code is running after successfully compiled
   - Exceptions
   - This error stops the interpreter from executing the code and where the error has occured & displays the error message
   - Any line before the error will be executed
   - Spelling errors
   - Divide a number by 0
   - add a character with a number
   - open a file which does not exist
